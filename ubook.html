									<h3 class="major">Process Overview</h3>
									<p>When i first began my class, I find textbooks for university courses are often expensive.Some books are too popular to rent from school’s bookstore.
										I hope to borrow or buy books from other students who take the same course in last quarter/year at Northeastern University. In addition, i also can get some experience from them. </p>

								 	 <h3 class="major">The Problem</h3>
								 	 <p> Textbooks for university courses are often expensive, and many college students cannot afford to buy all of them.
										  Moreover, students do not always use the books beyond their coursework.
											We want to design an app through which students in the same university can easily exchange, rent, buy, borrow, sell or lend books among themselves.</p>

						<h3 class="major">Interview--behavioral map--persona</h3>
						<p>To create our persona, we first worked on creating the behavioral map. We started by looking through our interview questions and writeups to identify the behavioral variables that were relevant to our concept.
							 Once we laid out these variables on scales with two extremes, we looked back at our interviewee writeups to figure out where each person would fall on these scales. </p>

								<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ubook/bemap.png" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
						</br>
							<p>By color coding the interviewees, it was easy for us to find the clusters and analyze the trends in the data.
								Based on this analysis, we identified the behavioral traits, goals, needs and pain points of our persona.
								We also came up with a fictional scenario to summarize what we learned from our interviewees.</P>

						  <h3 class="major">Usability Test</h3>
             <p>To improve the design of our app uBook, we conducted usability tests with students at Northeastern University.
							  We followed our test protocol and had our participants perform the tasks using our InVision prototype. </p>

								<h3 class="major">Common Trends and Problems</h3>
								<ul class="problem">
									<li>Overall, the participants found the app easy to use, with straightforward buying and selling processes.</li>
									<li>The idea and concept of the app seemed quite popular, and all of the participants said they would use or try out the service if it was available.</li>
									<li>Most of the participants had different expectations for what ‘Listings’ meant on the global navigation. It was not clear that it was where the user would sell their books.</li>
									<li>It was not immediately clear to the participants that their myNEU account would be linked to the app, and a lot of them expected to find a sign up option on the login screen.</li>
									<li>Some of the participants felt that ‘Notifications’ was not important enough to be featured on the global navigation.</li>
									<li>A few of the participants mentioned that, when creating a listing, they would like the pickup and shipping options to be under a single delivery option.</li>
								</ul>
							 </article>
							</section>
						</br>

						<h3 class="major">Proposed Changes</h3>
						<p><b>We propose the following changes to solve the above issues:</b></p>
						<ul class="">
							<li>Change the terminology used on the global navigation for the selling screen to something clearer than ‘Listings,’ e.g., ‘Sell.’</li>
							<li>Rethink what options should be on the global navigation and whether the home screen should go to ‘Search’ or a screen showing all listings available through the app.</li>
							<li>Make it clearer on the Login screen that the user’s myNEU account is linked to the app and what kind of information would be accessed by the app.</li>
							<li>Add a sort and filter feature to the listings screen.</li>
							<li>When creating a new listing, change the Pickup and Shipping options to a Delivery option.</li>
							<li>A few of the participants mentioned that, when creating a listing, they would like the pickup and shipping options to be under a single delivery option.</li>
						</ul>

						<p><b>The following are other minor changes or improving our design:</b></p>
						<ul class="">
							<li>Show the order details on the order confirmation screen.</li>
							<li>Add a link to view previous quarters on the search screen, but not as prominent as the buttons for the current and next quarters.</li>
							<li>On the book details screen, add an arrow in the first box (with the book and price details) so that clicking on it would show the book description and additional information from the seller.</li>
							<li>In ‘All’ tab in the book listings screen, mention if the each listing is for renting or buying (this information got lost because we took out the Rent and Buy buttons that we had initially placed there).</li>
							<li>When finding and buying a book, make the color of the book price consistent across all the screens.</li>
						</ul>
